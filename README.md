# Django App - Tracks Clicks and Cookies

An app that customers are directed to when they scan our label and tracks their clicks. The app is a link in bio landing page with multiple redirects and contact info buttons. We want to recreate this.

The reason we want to do this, is to avoid paying subscription fees for analytics provided by apps like linktree, linkpop, and linkinbio. It also gives us a way to customize our look and potentially test out new features.
